#### Instructions

It is recommended that you remove all launchers as well as Magisk and Xposed modules that
interact with launchers from your device, leaving only the default system launcher.

Pixel Launcher M will REPLACE your system launcher.

It cannot be installed alongside other versions of Pixel Launcher, because it uses Google's original package name.

Please please please install [BootloopSaver by HuskyDG](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Alt-Repo/HuskyDG_BootloopSaver) before installing PLM.

Update all your apps, especially Google apps.

Reboot your device.

#### For Magisk installation:

Simply download the .zip and install it from within Magisk.
PLM will load a Helper GUI to make installation selections.
Classic will simply install and reboot.

When your phone reboots, you should be in PLM, and you're good to go!

#### For Recovery installation:
