READ THIS DOCUMENT BEFORE YOU SEND ME YOUR LOG.TXT FILE



What is this folder? What is PLM? Who put this here?

This folder was created when you installed Pixel Launcher M.
It contains some wallpapers, and a log.txt installation logfile.

log.txt is created when you install PLM, and contains information about the state of your device during installation.
This file can be helpful to me when you want to report problems.
It never leaves your device unless you manually send it to me.
Google, however, includes some network logging features in Pixel Launcher that are still present and I have not disabled.

log.txt contains a great deal of information about your device.
It does not contain any personally sensitive information.
It does not contain your account information or name.
It does contain your device's unique serial number.
(I don't need or want your serial number, but the difference between requesting everything
and requesting everything but one thing is like 1000 lines of additional code work.)
It does contain every available detail about your hardware.
It does contain every available detail about your operating system.
It does contain a great deal of information about processes running on your device.

In the wrong hands, paired with some additional personally identifiable information,
which could be obtained via the account you communicate this information from,
this could potentially be very dangerous to your security and privacy.
For this reason, I will not accept it if you send this file to me in a public way.

If you feel there is too much information in this file to send me, you can freely edit the plain text document,
or simply send me only a few details, although this may make fixing the problem you're having more difficult.

Before you submit your logfile and error report to me, please consider trying a few possible solutions:

- Disable other Magisk and Xposed modules.

- Uninstall recent apps that you've downloaded since the problem began.

- Reboot your device.

- Check for updates to PLM, Magisk, and your system.

If you would like to submit log.txt to me to assist in diagnosing and solving problems you may have with Pixel Launcher M,
please send it privately to me on Telegram @GoriLovesYou with a detailed explanation of your issue.

Please include in your explanation details such as:

- What precisely is happening.

- What you expected to happen instead.

- How you can go about replicating the problem.

- What you have already tried to fix the problem.

If you send the logfile publicly in a place I moderate, I will delete the message and tell you to read this.

If you send me the logfile without an explanation of your problem, I will tell you to read this.

Thank you for reading and thank you for sending logs and feedback.
