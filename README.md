#### Pixel Launcher Classic:

Classic is a version of PLM that is stripped down to the basics.

It is very close to Google's original Pixel Launcher,

with only a few performance tweaks and bug fixes.

It is provided as a minimal option for people that want the Pixel Launcher,

without all the additions of Pixel Launcher M.
