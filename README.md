This is a mirror of my personal project folder for PLM, and is not organized as a single release.

It will be continuously mirroring my work, including between [releases](https://github.com/TeamFiles/PixelLauncherM/releases), for those that want to follow along.

The [Telegram channel](https://t.me/PixelLauncherM) would be the best place to start if you want to use PLM and don't know what you need.

The [Telegram channel](https://t.me/PixelLauncherM) also hosts additional files not in the [releases](https://github.com/TeamFiles/PixelLauncherM/releases), although those are generally included in the [repo's Other folder](/Other).

You can jump directly to the [releases page](https://github.com/TeamFiles/PixelLauncherM/releases) if you just need the newest package to flash.

Please visit https://t.me/PixelLauncherM for further information.

You can also always [contact Gori directly](https://t.me/GoriLovesYou) if you need help. üíöÔ∏è
