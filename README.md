#### v1.6.0-beta

- Numerous changes. Still setting up the essentials...

#### v1.3.0 and earlier

- Not recommended to install.

#### About:

Pixel Launcher M is a launcher application for Android devices based on Google's Pixel Launcher and other Launcher3 projects. We aim to make a better launcher experience while retaining ALL of the features that are exclusive to Google's Pixel Launcher. It is available mainly as a Magisk module for Android 12.0 and up. We offer recovery flashable versions as well, with slightly limited features.

This repo also contains flashable releases for Google Pixel Launcher as it was released by Google, adding only a few external bonuses for performance and optimization, and expanding the themed icon set significantly. Look for the GPL packages in releases.

The [Telegram channel](https://t.me/PixelLauncherM) is a great place to check for additional information.

You can also always [contact Gori directly](https://t.me/GoriLovesYou) if you need help. üíöÔ∏è

#### Requirements:

- Magisk 24.0+ OR capable recovery (TWRP)
- Android 12.0, 12.1, OR 13

#### Features:

- Our custom Launcher Enhancer script for optimal performance
- Enables newest features in At A Glance automatically (At A Glance Enhancer flags)
- Over 1000 custom icons by the #TeamFiles Monet Icons Group
- Kind of sort of depending on your device, includes Double Tap to Sleep
- 12.1 versions include additional grid size options (work in progress)
- Plenty of tweaks and corrections to make Pixel Launcher shine on non-Pixel devices

#### Installation:

- It is recommended that you remove all launchers as well as Magisk and Xposed modules that interact with launchers from your device, leaving only the default system launcher.
- Pixel Launcher M will REPLACE your system launcher.
- It cannot be installed alongside other versions of Pixel Launcher, because it uses Google's original package name.
- Please install [BootloopSaver by HuskyDG](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Alt-Repo/HuskyDG_BootloopSaver) before installing PLM.
- Update all your apps, especially Google apps.
- Reboot your device.
- It is recommended you install [Android System Intelligence](/Other/Apps/ASI) if you don't already have it. CAUTION: If you have ASI's OEM version, it will most likely bootloop for you if you try to install the Pixel 6 version! Some features unfortunately may be inaccessable on your device.
- Now you can download the .zip from [the releases page](https://www.GitHub.com/TeamFiles/PixelLauncherM/releases) and install it from within Magisk or your compatible recovery.
- When you reboot your device, you should be in PLM, and you're good to go!

#### Having issues?

Some known issues:
- DT2S crashes on devices unless signature verification is ignored, by default in your ROM or by other means
- Tapping weather in the Smart space should open Google's weather results, but does nothing at all
- Pixel Launcher M does not respond to requests from other apps to create shortcuts
- Many grid size options that have been added have strangely displayed padding on some devices

If you're experiencing issues not listed here, please reach out to us in [the Telegram group](https://t.me/PixelLauncherMchat) or add to the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/TeamFiles/PixelLauncherM/issues).

#### More about this repo:

This repo is mirroring my (possibly messy and confusing) personal project folder, containing past versions and additional files, as well as compress, uncompressed, and decompiled versions of everything. It's not really intended for you to download UNLESS you intend to modify it. If you want to download PLM to install it, stick to the releases. ALL of the compressed releases are also contained in the repo under their versioning folders. I felt this would be the easiest (laziest) way for me to continuously provide updates to people who are really very interested, while maintaining easy delivery to people that just want releases.

#### DIY:

If you're editing this stuff yourself, I highly recommend you try out [Apktool M](https://t.me/apktool_m) and [MT Manager](https://t.me/mtmanager), both powerful tools that are essential to this project.

You may also be interested in using my signing key if you're making your own version. It is available to everyone in [THIS FOLDER](/Other/Key) of the repo.
