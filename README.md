### About

Pixel Launcher M is a replacement for your default system launcher. It aims to provide all the features from Pixel Launcher to more users, and add more features along the way. We're working hard to bring this to a more stable state and fix some issues. Join us on Telegram to follow the progress!

### Changelog

#### v1.1.0

- Fixes related to the app drawer search bar coloring. Again.

- Some changes to additional grid options. Still needs more work.

- Stopped using superrepack for the time being, until I can make it safer to use for everyone.

- Changed the icon again. Hopefully people like this one.

- Tried to fix installation on A13, which wasn't really working right.

#### v1.0.0

- Release

### Known Issues

- Tapping on the weather in the smartspace doesn't do anything.

- Trying to create shortcuts on the homescreen fails.

- DT2S crashes on a lot of devices.

- Grid options that weren't available originally display strangely sometimes.

### Installation

#### Requirements

- Android version 12.0, 12.1, or 13

- Root with Magisk version 20.4+ required, 24.3+ recommended

A recovery flashable version is coming soon

#### Instructions

- It is recommended that you remove all launchers as well as Magisk and Xposed modules that
interact with launchers from your device, leaving only the default system launcher.

- Pixel Launcher M will REPLACE your system launcher.

- It cannot be installed alongside other versions of Pixel Launcher, because it uses Google's original package name.

- Please install [BootloopSaver by HuskyDG](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Alt-Repo/HuskyDG_BootloopSaver) before installing PLM.

- Update all your apps, especially Google apps.

- Reboot your device.

- Simply download the .zip and install it from within Magisk.

- When you reboot your device, you should be in PLM, and you're good to go!

#### Still need help?

If PLM is crashing repeatedly:

- Try going into settings and clearing data for PLM, providing all permissions to PLM, and manually setting PLM as your launcher, and force stopping it.

If your phone bootloops:

- Try not installing ASI, or installing a different version of ASI.

- If PLM is crashing under other specific conditions:

- Please contact me and provide a report.
