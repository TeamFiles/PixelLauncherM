Pixel Launcher M is in active development. Join us on Telegram to help test it!

Pixel Launcher M aims to bring together features from many popular launchers.

The package uses the same name as Google's to access some of their features, and therefore can't easily be installed alongside the original Pixel Launcher.

Pixel Launcher will initially be available as a Magisk module, with a recovery flashable package soon to follow. You can also simply download the modified NexusLauncherRelease.apk for more advanced use.

This project is in no way affiliated with Google.
